# `signals`

According to the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, a signal can be audio, video, speech, image, sonar and radar-related and so on.  In a later effort of redefining a signal,[2] anything that is only a function of space, such as an image, is excluded from the category of signals. Also, it is stated that a signal may or may not contain any information.

In human engineering, signals are typically provided by a sensor, and often the original form of a signal is converted to another form of energy using a transducer. For example, a microphone converts an acoustic signal to a voltage waveform, and a speaker does the reverse.[1]
